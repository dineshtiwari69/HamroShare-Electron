# ⚙️ HamroShare : Batch IPO Applier (ELECTRON)

HamroShare-Electron is a desktop client for HamroShare.

Note: It loads https://dineshtiwari69.github.io/HamroShare/ into electron , the only difference between the desktop and webapp client is that we can use Meroshare's WEB API bypassing COR'S Restriction which seems more stable than using Mobile API .

## FAQ

#### Why Desktop App  ?

Today : 6/11/2022 HamroShare's Web APP was not working because Meroshare's Mobile API seems to be down atm . So i had to create this so that we can have two options (Meorshare's WEB API & Mobile API)
